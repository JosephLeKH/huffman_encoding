# Huffman Coding Project  

## Overview  

This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a data compression algorithm devised by David Huffman in 1952. Huffman coding is widely used in data compression for applications such as HDTV, fax machines, and file formats like JPEG. By leveraging trees and priority queues, this program can compress and decompress files effectively.  

The implementation provides a complete compression and decompression pipeline. It encodes files into a compact representation using a Huffman tree and can reconstruct the original files with no loss of information. This project demonstrates a powerful and elegant algorithm for practical use in data handling and showcases the capabilities of modern C++ programming.

  - Compress files into a compact binary format.  
  - Decompress files to restore the original content.  

- **General File Support:**  
  - Handles text, binary, and multimedia files.  
  - Works with any input containing at least two distinct characters.  

- **End-to-End Testing:**  
  - Supports comprehensive testing with round-trip compression and decompression.  

- **Memory Management:**  
  - Efficient handling of dynamic memory with no leaks.  

- **Interactive Console Program:**  
  - A user-friendly interface to compress and decompress files.

## How It Works  

### Core Components  

1. **Huffman Tree:**  
   - Constructs an optimal binary tree using a priority queue to represent character frequencies.  
   - Each character is mapped to a unique binary sequence, with shorter sequences for more frequent characters.  

2. **Compression:**  
   - **Encoding:** Converts characters into binary sequences based on the Huffman tree.  
   - **Flattening:** Stores the Huffman tree in a serialized format for future decompression.  

3. **Decompression:**  
   - **Unflattening:** Reconstructs the Huffman tree from its serialized format.  
   - **Decoding:** Translates binary sequences back into the original characters.  

4. **File Handling:**  
   - Compresses data into `.huf` files.  
   - Restores original data from `.huf` files, preserving the file type and content.

## File Descriptions  

### Core Implementation  

- **`huffman.cpp` and `huffman.h`:**  
  Implements all core Huffman functions, including tree construction, compression, and decompression.  

- **`bits.cpp` and `bits.h`:**  
  Manages bit-level operations, including reading and writing bits to streams.  

- **`treenode.h`:**  
  Defines the `EncodedTreeNode` structure used for Huffman tree nodes.  

- **`priorityqueue.h`:**  
  Provides a priority queue implementation for building the Huffman tree.  

### Helper Files  

- **`main.cpp`:**  
  A console-based interface for testing compression and decompression functionality.

# Getting Started  

## Prerequisites  

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)  
- A development environment capable of running C++ projects

## Testing  

### Adding Custom Tests  

To validate the correctness of the program, use the round-trip compression-decompression method:

1. Compress a file.  
2. Decompress the result.  
3. Compare it with the original file.  

---

## Example Usage  

### 1. Compress a File  

- **Input:** `res/example.txt`  
- **Output:** `res/example.txt.huf`  

### 2. Decompress a File  

- **Input:** `res/example.txt.huf`  
- **Output:** `res/unhuf.example.txt`

## Additional Notes  

- **Compression Efficiency:**  
  Compression efficiency depends on the redundancy in the input file. Files with repeated patterns compress well, while already compressed files may grow slightly in size.  

- **Memory Management:**  
  The project ensures no memory leaks using proper tree deallocation and careful memory management.  

- **Non-Text File Support:**  
  Non-text files like images and audio can be compressed and decompressed accurately.  

---

## Known Limitations  

- **Input Restrictions:**  
  Input must contain at least two distinct characters to be Huffman-encodable.  

- **Compression Growth:**  
  Huffman encoding does not guarantee size reduction for already compressed files.
